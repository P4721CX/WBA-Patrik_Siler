                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Patrik Šiler. I'm student of the <a href="https://www.ssps.cz/">SSPŠ</a> high school,
                and I'm from the Czech Republic. Every day I learn new stuff and at the moment I've got the basics of
                coding in C#, editing videos, drawing, working with Unity, AutoCAD, Filmora and more.
                In the future I want to become a programmer, and although I'm just a beginner of these things
                I've done some works, some projects that I'm proud of. Whether it's programmes, drawings or just some funny videos.
                Furthermore, I'm learning to code websites like the one you're just looking at, and I hope I'll get better 
                at it as the time goes by.
                
                Anyway, down below you can look at some of my works, that I've mentioned earlier.

                    <p>These are some of my projects that I've been working on.</p>

                    <p>When I was little, I've been editing some funny videos with my friends.
                        I've done them in programmes like Camtasia and Filmora. 
                        Nowadays, I don't do these any more, but after this period of editing videos I started drawing
                        in programmes such as Medibang Paint Pro and Krita.</p>

                    <!--PixelArt-->
                    <p>Now I'm more into pixel art. In my opinion, pixel art style is better because it's easier to make
                        and also 'cause I can use them in my games that I make, which is my newest passion.

                    <p>I haven't done any full game yet, however I've got a few in progress. The only game I made in
                        Unity was my Meteor Strike, which is a total copy of Sebastian Lague's game called Falling Blocks.

                    <p>Right now, I want to get better at programming, so I can make some kind of popular game, 
                        I want to learn with Arduino and finally get better at coding websites.
